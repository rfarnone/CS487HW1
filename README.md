This project required making a CNN to categorize 102 different types of flowers. After creating a CNN with a required 80% accuracy we implemented FGSM and PGM attacks on the CNN. The graphs of the accuracy and loss are for a test done with 15 patience for the Early Stopping function while the table recording values in for the model and the associated attacks are based off of a model ran at 10 patience.
